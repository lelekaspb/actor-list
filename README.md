Simple webpage that displays a list of actors.

The list is read from a JSON-file containing a single array. Each item in the array contains the full name of the actor, and a movie they appear in. There are four different movies: Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Goodfellas, and Inception.

By default,the actors are sorted by first name.

The user is able to:

- click on a actor, and see a "pop-up" box with detailed information,
- filter the actors by movies,
- sort actors by first name or last name.
